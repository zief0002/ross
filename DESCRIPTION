Description: To control order effects in questionnaires containing paired 	comparisons, Ross (1934) described an optimal ordering of the 
	pairings. The functions in this package construct the optimally 	spaced, balanced ordering of pairings. They can also create
	subsets of the pairs for either a matrix-sampling design or a fully 	incomplete design.
